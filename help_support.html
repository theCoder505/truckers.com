                        <p>
                            To operate a trucking company in the U.S., the government mandates that you have Primary Auto Liability insurance with a minimum limit of $750,000. However, most trucking companies also purchase 1) Physical Damage, 2) Motor Truck Cargo, and 3) General Liability so that they have comprehensive coverage. Without these other coverages, you’re not fully protecting your truck, your cargo, and your business in the event of an accident.

                        <p>LuckyTruck’s goal is to make understanding and managing your insurance as easy as possible - that’s why we created the LuckyTruck Dashboard! After purchasing a policy, you can log into your dashboard at any time and directly make changes to your policy. Want to add a vehicle? Head to the Vehicles tab and add that freightliner! Need to remove an old driver? Go to the Drivers tab and click “remove” on the driver you’d like to take off the policy. It’s as simple as that!</p>

                        <p>After binding your policy your Agent will ensure we have all of the post-bind documents needed such as Proof-of-Prior and Loss Runs. Once your Agent has collected all of the necessary documents, they will introduce you to your LuckyTruck Account Manager – a specialized insurance Agent who has been paired with you based on your business’s profile. Your Account Manager will handle all of your service needs such as generating COIs and processing endorsements.</p>

                        <div class="panel">
                           <p>The price of insurance is based on dozens of factors - some obvious and some less obvious - and these factors vary between insurance carriers. Examples of factors include: vehicle value, driving record, type of commodities being hauled, deductible amounts, and years in business. Even the smallest change to one of these dozens of factors can lead to higher or lower insurance costs. To understand why your insurance is a certain price or if you want to make sure your insurance accurately reflects your business, please reach out to your Account Manager</p>

                           <p>After logging into your LuckyTruck dashboard, head over to the Certificate Holders tab. From there, you can click “Get a Certificate,” enter your certificate holder’s details, choose whether you’d also like to send this certificate to anyone else on your account, and then hit “Request.” This will generate a certificate of insurance tailored to your active policies, store it in your “Documents” section, and send it directly over to that Certificate Holder’s email address.</p>
